 In this project, I performed various analyses using the 'Netflix Movies and TV Shows' dataset from Kaggle.
 
**Netflix Movies and TV Shows Data Analysis ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“º**

This project involves a comprehensive analysis conducted using the "Netflix Movies and TV Shows" dataset obtained from Kaggle. Instead of directly downloading the dataset, I accessed and analyzed the data rapidly and efficiently via a kaggle.json file. âš¡

**Project Goal:** This project aims to provide data-driven insights by visualizing the distribution, popularity trends, and key characteristics of Netflix content.

**Implemented Analysis Steps and Problems Addressed:**

**1-) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**

Detection and cleaning of Null values within the dataset from relevant columns were performed.

A working copy of the original dataset was created to preserve its integrity.

**2-) Content Type Distribution Analysis:**

The numerical distribution of "Movie" and "TV Show" content on the Netflix platform was visualized using a Bar Chart, determining the general structure of the content portfolio.

**3-) Age Category (Rating) Analysis:**

The age rating ratios (Rating) of the content were analyzed using another Bar Chart. This clearly revealed the distribution of content suitable for users' age categories.

Additionally, the distributions of "Movie" and "TV Show" content across different age categories were also examined with a similar Bar Chart.

**4-) Genre Distribution and Rating Ratios Visualization:**

The distribution of series/film genres was made more distinct using a Pie Chart.

Similarly, the overall distribution of age ratings (Rating) was also visualized via a Pie Chart.

**5-) Actor Analysis (Word Cloud):**

Using the WordCloud library, the names of the most frequently appearing actors in the dataset were analyzed with a prominent visual (Word Cloud). This provided a quick insight into popular actor trends.

**Tools and Libraries Used:**

This project was developed using the Python programming language and leveraged the following libraries:

**Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.

**NumPy:** For numerical operations (a dependency for Pandas).

**Seaborn:** For creating aesthetic and informative statistical graphics.

**Matplotlib:** For detailed customization of plots.

**WordCloud:** For generating word cloud visuals from text data.
